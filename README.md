# Gridlock
Gridlock is a turn-based strategy game, where players take control of various military units and engage in tactical combat with enemy forces on grid-based maps. The goal is to defeat the enemy's units and capture their headquarters, while managing resources and protecting one's own troops.

The game features a variety of different units, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and movement ranges. Players must carefully plan their movements and attacks in order to outmaneuver and overwhelm their opponents.
