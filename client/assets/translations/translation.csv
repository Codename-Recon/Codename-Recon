,,,
ANTI_AIR,Anti-Air,,
ANTI_AIR_DESCRIPTION,"Anti-Airs are strong at fighting Air units, but are also strong at combating foot soldiers and light vehicles.",,
,,,
APC,APC,,
APC_DESCRIPTION,"Defenseless on their own, Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) instead support an army by transporting Foot Soldiers and refilling Fuel and Ammo stocks of adjacent units.",,
,,,
ARTILLERY,Artillery,,
ARTILLERY_DESCRIPTION,Artillery are low-cost indirect vehicles. They serve as the primary defensive unit projecting power across front-lines.,,
,,,
BAZOOKA,Mech,,
BAZOOKA_DESCRIPTION,"Stronger, slower, and more expensive than Infantry, Mechanized Infantry (more commonly referred to as Mechs) trade versatility for much greater cost-efficiency against a variety of targets.",,
,,,
INFANTRY,Infantry,,
INFANTRY_DESCRIPTION,"The cheapest unit available in AWBW, Infantry are nonetheless an incredibly important unit and should not be overlooked.",,
,,,
MEDIUM_TANK,Medium Tank,,
MEDIUM_TANK_DESCRIPTION,"Larger, slower, and considerably more powerful than Tanks, Medium Tanks (Often abbreviated Md. Tank) are forces to be reckoned with.",,
,,,
RECON,Recon,,
RECON_DESCRIPTION,"Light, fast, and inexpensive, Recons make excellent scouting and harassment units.",,
,,,
ROCKET,Rocket,,
ROCKET_DESCRIPTION,"The more advanced version of Artillery, Rockets trade higher damage and a much larger range for lighter armor and a more restrictive movement type.",,
,,,
LIGHT_TANK,Light Tank,,
LIGHT_TANK_DESCRIPTION,"Inexpensive, fast, and able to hold its own against most other land units, Tanks are a cornerstone unit in any army.",,
,,,
,,,
AIRPORT,Airport,,
AIRPORT_DESCRIPTION,"Airports are an important hub for all air units, being the only tile that is able to deploy, repair and resupply them, while also providing funds. Freshly built units may not take actions on the same turn they are deployed.",,
,,,
BASE,Base,,
BASE_DESCRIPTION,"Bases providing income, repairs and supplies to land units. Crucially, they are also are where all land units are deployed from, at the cost of funds. Units are considered 'waited' and cannot take actions on the same turn they are deployed.",,
,,,
BEACH,Shoats,,
BEACH_DESCRIPTION,"Shoals are the most universally traversed terrain. Only Piperunners and non-Lander units are prohibited from traveling on Shoals. They are also easy to travel across, regardless of weather; with the exception of Air units, Shoals always cost only 1 movement point to traverse. The downside of this is the fact that Shoals provide no defensive bonuses whatsoever, so units left on Shoals will be vulnerable.",,
,,,
CITY,City,,
CITY_DESCRIPTION,Cities are the most basic property and the most common one seen. They provide income every turn and can be used to repair and resupply land units that stand on them at the start of each turn.,,
,,,
FOREST,Woods,,
FOREST_DESCRIPTION,"Woods may be difficult for vehicles to traverse, but they provide benefits for units that do travel to them. Units stationed in Woods will gain 2 Defense stars, translating to 20% less damage taken from enemy attacks. While this is not as big of a benefit as parking on a property, Woods are generally less contested areas, and still provide enough defense to save your units from 1 HP damage taken as opposed to if the unit were on a Road or a Plain.",,
,,,
GRASS,Plains,,
GRASS_DESCRIPTION,"Plains are typically the most common terrain feature on any given map. They provide quick, efficient movement for most units, and also provides a very slight defense boost when units are stationed on them.",,
,,,
MOUNTAIN,Mountains,,
MOUNTAIN_DESCRIPTION,"Mountains are difficult terrain to navigate, being only passable by Foot Soldiers (and even then slowing Infantry) and Air units. Foot Soldiers benefit from very high defensive bonuses when stationed in Mountains, taking 40% less damage while they are there.",,
,,,
QG,Headquarters,,
QG_DESCRIPTION,"The Headquarters is the most strategically important property on any map, as in addition to providing income and repairs, supplies and Terrain Stars4 of defense for land units, it functions as one of the opposing players' Victory Conditions, where its capture will count as a defeat for the owning player. If multiple HQs are present on a map, the capture of any one of them will count as a defeat for that player.",,
,,,
RIVER,River,,
RIVER_DESCRIPTION,"Rivers are one of the less ideal terrain features in the game to travel through or around. Land vehicles cannot cross them, requiring another path to get to areas blocked off by Rivers. Foot soldiers may ford them, but Infantry will be slowed down considerably in the process.",,
,,,
ROAD,Road,,
ROAD_DESCRIPTION,"Roads and Bridges are the most basic terrain feature in the game. They are always the quickest route of travel for land units, always costing only 1 Movement Point to traverse per tile, even if it is Raining or Snowing. The downside of Roads and Bridges is that they provide no defensive bonuses to units stationed on them. While efficient for quick travel, roads should be avoided for when holding defensive positions, as any unit on Roads or Bridges will take full damage from any given attack.",,
,,,
SEA,Sea,,
SEA_DESCRIPTION,"Functioning similarly to Roads, but for Naval units, Sea tiles offer quick movement, at the cost of providing no defensive benefits whatsoever.",,
